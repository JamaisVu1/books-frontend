## Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

- Bring it up with the other person and work out a plan to prevent it from happening again.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

- Mention it and ensure both partners are contributing.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Coming from a place of understanding, and taking it as a teaching opportunity as well as an opportunity to help a peer.
